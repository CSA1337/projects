# Project background
The python project stores and fetch the data from the JSON file. Any changes made to the product, courier and order will be saved when the program exit. An end user can perform all the CRUD functions.

# Client requirements
- A product, courier, and order should be a dictionary.
- Data should be persisted to a .csv file on a new line for each courier, order, and product.

# How did your design go about meeting the project's requirements?
Almost 90% of the project requirements have been accomplished apart from the product. The product should be a dictionary, but it is a list in this project.

# How did you guarantee the project's requirements?
Making sure everyone's on the same page, including the stakeholders.

# If you had more time, what is one thing you would improve upon?
OOP programming and unit testing

# What did you most enjoy implementing?
Implementing the python echo system and separating files from the main python file. Making the program more small and clean.
